Project for ASVspoof 2021 

General
----------
This project is for ASVspoof 2021 LA baseline.
But it may be used for PA too

1. lfcc-lcnn-lstm-p2s_toy_example: a toy example to train and run evaluation
2. lfcc-lcnn-lstm-p2s_baseline (to be uploaded after the release of ASVspoof 2021 data)

Usage
----------
Either run the single script
 $: 00_toy_example.sh

Or these three setps:
1. install conda environment:
   $: bash 01_conda.sh
2. untar the toy data set
   $: cd DATA
   $: tar -xzvf toy_example.tar.gz
   $: cd ..
3. run scripts
   $: cd lfcc-lcnn-lstm-p2s_toy_example
   # evaluation using pre-trained model
   $: bash 01_eval.sh
   # training, with pre-trained model as initialization
   $: bash 00_train.sh

Folder structure
----------------
|- DATA
|  |- toy_example
|  |  |- protocol.txt: 
|  |  |   protocol file
|  |  |   this will be loaded by pytorch code for training and evaluation
|  |  |- scp: 
|  |  |   list of files for traing, dev, and eval
|  |  |- train_dev: 
|  |  |   waveform for train and validation sets   
|  |  |- eval: 
|  |  |   waveform for evaluation sets   
|
|- lfcc-lcnn-lstmsum-p2s_toy_example
|  |  folder for the toy example
|  |  |- 00_train.sh: recipe to train the model
|  |  |- 01_eval.sh: command line to evaluate the model on eval set
|  |  |- main.py: main function
|  |  |- config.py: configuration file
|  |  |- model.py: definition of model in Pytorch code
|  |  |- __pretrained
|  |       |- trained_network.pt: pre-trained model 
|  |       |   from ../03-asvspoof-mega/lfcc-lcnn-lstmsum-p2s/04

Note
----------
1. If GPU memory is insufficient, please reduce --batch-size in */00_train.sh

2. Output score has this following format:

   Output, File name, label, score
   Output, LA_E_8688127, 0, -0.011127

   If label of the trial is given in the protocol file, the label will be: 
     0, which denotes spoof
     1, which denotes bona fide
   If label of the trial is not given in the protocol file, the label will be:
    -1, which means unknown (not provided)

3. Accordingly, the code assumes 0 and 1 as the tables for spoof and bona fide
   trials, respectively. 

4. Please check ../03-asvspoof-mega if you want to use other models. 
   However, model.py ../03-asvspoof-mega assumes that trial labels are available 
   for evaluation set (as post-challenge experiments on ASVspoof2019 LA).

   For new evaluation set whose trial labels are unknown, please create
   protocol.txt using dummy labels for the trials. 
   Or, please modify protocol_parse() and _get_target_eval() 
   following lfcc-lcnn-lstm-p2s_toy_example/model.py

   (Apologize that I don't have the time to modify the model.py in 03-asvspoof-mega 
    one by one)
     
5. The used countermeasure model is detailed here https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11326.


That's all
