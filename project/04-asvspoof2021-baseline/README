Project for ASVspoof 2021 

General
----------
This project is for ASVspoof 2021 LA baseline.
But it may be used for PA too

1. lfcc-lcnn-lstm-p2s_toy_example: a toy example to train and run evaluation
2. lfcc-lcnn-lstm-p2s_baseline (to be uploaded after the release of ASVspoof 2021 data)

Usage
----------
Either run the single script
 $: 00_toy_example.sh

Or these three setps:
1. install conda environment:
   $: bash 01_conda.sh
2. untar the toy data set
   $: cd DATA
   $: tar -xzvf toy_example.tar.gz
   $: cd ..
3. run scripts
   $: cd lfcc-lcnn-lstm-p2s_toy_example
   # evaluation using pre-trained model
   $: bash 01_eval.sh
   # training, with pre-trained model as initialization
   $: bash 00_train.sh

|  |  |- eval: 
|  |  |   waveform for evaluation sets   
|
|- lfcc-lcnn-lstmsum-p2s_toy_example
|  |  folder for the toy example
|  |  |- 00_train.sh: recipe to train the model
|  |  |- 01_eval.sh: command line to evaluate the model on eval set
|  |  |- main.py: main function

Note
----------
1. If GPU memory is insufficient, please reduce --batch-size in */00_train.sh
2. Please check ..//03-asvspoof-mega if you want to use other models
3. The used countermeasure model is detailed here https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11326.
